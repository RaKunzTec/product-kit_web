Product Kit for Web provides components for Daimler TSS web frontends based on Material Web Components.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Daimler/product-kit_web/issues) or provide a pull request with the desired modifications.

## Examples
![Component Overview](https://github.com/Daimler/product-kit_web/raw/main/docs/images/component-overview-teaser.png)

## Installation

*Note that you must have node (and npm) installed.*

Install the npm package from the root directory through:
```
npm install @daimler/productkit-web
```

Import `styles.scss` inside your App.scss or similar root styling scss file:
```scss
@import "@daimler/productkit-react/src/theme/scss/styles";
```

Your Material components should now be styled accordingly to the styleguide of Daimler TSS!

## Usage

Add a component like for instance a button as stated in the Material [documentation/examples](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/v10.0.0/packages/mdc-button):
```html
<button class="mdc-button">
    <span class="mdc-button__ripple"></span>
    <span class="mdc-button__label">Text Button</span>
</button>
```

You don't need to import any styling as Product Kit does all the styling for you!

Add ripple effect or other modifications in your App.js:
```javascript
import {MDCRipple} from '@material/ripple';

const buttonRipple = new MDCRipple(document.querySelector('.mdc-button'));
```

Please look up other components in the [Material documentation](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/v10.0.0/packages).
